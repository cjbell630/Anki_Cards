        The following is a special trick I had to do to get things to work properly on Anki.

        First off, Anki loads a single WebView per session, and never loads js files twice.
        This means that any code in a js file set to run on load (ie. anything outside of a "function" block)
        only gets called once, on the initial load.

        A simple solution to this would simply be to put everything needed to be called on load in its own function,
        then simply load the file, and call the function in two separate `<script></script>` blocks. However, Anki also
        loads js files (and possibly blocks) asynchronously. This means that the script block containing the launch
        function could be called before the js file, resulting in a `function not defined` error.

        Based on a solution I found on Reddit for a similar problem [TODO: link] I have come up with the following:

        Check if the js file has been loaded in yet. If it has, call the `checkElements` function. If it hasn't, create
        a new script element with its source as the js file, and add it to the document.
        The js file calls the `checkElements` as its final line, so there won't be any issues if it's called for the
        first time.
        -->
        <script>
            if (typeof checkElements == "undefined") {
                let script = document.createElement('script');
                script.src = "kanji-checker.js";
                script.async = false;
                document.head.appendChild(script);
            } else {
                checkElements();
            }
        </script>

    </body>
