# anki-cards

This is a collection of code I use in my Anki cards, and some tools I made to speed up the creation process. So far,
they're all focused on learning Japanese. I figured I'd share it in case it helps anyone else.

# [Pitch Accent Drawer][0] #

Draws the pitch accent pattern for a word on the Anki card. You specify the pattern in a field for each word.

# [Kanji Checker [SECTION INCOMPLETE]][2] #

Creates a special field where Anki can automatically display a word in hiragana if you haven't learned the kanji for it
yet. Basically makes it so that you only ever need to enter each word once, rather than having to go back and edit it
once you learn the kanji for it.

# [Ruby Text Editor [SECTION INCOMPLETE]][3] #

Allows you to edit Ruby text (called furigana for Japanese words) that can be copied directly into Anki. It looks like
this:

<span style="font-size:4em;">
    <ruby>日<rp>(</rp><rt>に</rt><rp>)</rp>本<rp>(</rp><rt>ほん</rt><rp>)</rp>語<rp>(</rp><rt>ご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
</span>
